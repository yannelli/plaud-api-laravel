| Test Case
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| The closure you provide to your test functions is always bound to a specific
| PHPUnit test case class. By default, that class is "PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase".
| Of course, you may need to change it using the "pest()" function to bind a
| different classes or traits to your test cases.

| Expectations
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain
| conditions. Pest provides several "expectations" which are assertions that
| verify that a given value matches specific conditions.

| Functions
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| While Pest is very powerful out-of-the-box, you may have some testing code
| specific to your project that you don't want to repeat in every file. Here
| you can also expose helpers as global functions to help you reduce the
| number of lines of code in your test files.
